# TODO:

- [ ] Correct the error when using modified Sobolev estimate, it doesn't hold when K depends on epsilon, we should generalize the modified Sobolev estimate.
- [ ] Try to give a global in time estimate for d=3 by using scattering theory
- [ ] Make the article look cleaner and easier to read
